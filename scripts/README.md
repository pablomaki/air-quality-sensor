# Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts for interacting with the air quality sensor. Each advertised service is read by the script and published to a MQTT topic as is.

## Files

- **aqs_ble_client.py**: A Python script for communicating with the air quality sensor over BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) and publishing the data to MQTT topics.

## Usage
To use the script, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. In addition, make sure the device is already paired with the system running the bluetooth script as otherwise the connection will not work.

Pairing can be done using `bluetoothctl` or any other bluetooth management tool. Start the bluetoothctl tool and use the following commands:

```bash
sudo bluetoothctl

# Enable agent (handles pairing)
[bluetooth]# agent on
[bluetooth]# default-agent

# Scan for devices
[bluetooth]# scan on

# When you see your device, pair it
[bluetooth]# pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

# Trust the device for automatic reconnection
[bluetooth]# trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
```

Note that this can be only done when the device is in pairing mode (indicated by the text "Pairing" on the screen).

When the device is successfully paired, run the script with the following command:

```bash
python aqs_ble_client.py
```

Make sure to configure the MQTT settings in the script before running it. The script will scan for BLE devices, connect to the air quality sensor, and publish the sensor data to the specified MQTT topics.

### Published Topics
The script publishes the following topics:
- `{SENSOR_NAME}/battery_level`: Battery level of the sensor (%).
- `{SENSOR_NAME}/pressure`: Pressure readings from the sensor (hPa).
- `{SENSOR_NAME}/temperature`: Temperature readings from the sensor (Â°C).
- `{SENSOR_NAME}/humidity`: Humidity readings from the sensor (%RH).
- `{SENSOR_NAME}/co2_concentration`: CO2 concentration readings from the sensor (ppm).
- `{SENSOR_NAME}/voc_index`: VOC index readings from the sensor (0-500).
