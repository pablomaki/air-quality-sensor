# Enclosure Design

This directory contains the enclosure design files for the air quality sensor.

The enclosure attaches to the pcb using two M3 screws that attach to the heat insert nuts on the enclosure bottom. The screen is friction fit to the top part of the enclosure and finally, the top of the enclosure is friction fit on the bottom part. Some sanding might be required depending on the 3D printer tolerances.
